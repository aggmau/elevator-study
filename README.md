#Disclaimer
This documentation is actually an assignment for a Coursera Course 


The elevator has a current floor, it also has a top and a bottom floor that are the minimum and maximum floors it can go to. 
Elevator can go through the floors requested.
The elevator shouldn't go above the top floor or below the bottom floor.
When printing the elevator using the print( ) method, we get the current floor together with a message.
